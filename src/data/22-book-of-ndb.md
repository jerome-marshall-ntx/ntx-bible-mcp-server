Nutanix Database Service (NDB) is a Database-as-a-Service that simplifies and automates database lifecycle management across on-premises and public clouds for Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB databases. With NDB, organizations can make database provisioning simple, fast, and secure to support agile application development,  while efficiently and securely managing hundreds to thousands of databases to meet performance, availability, and cost requirements. 

NDB can be deployed on any Nutanix cluster, including Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2) in the public cloud on AWS. Clusters can run AHV or ESXi. NDB takes advantage of Nutanix AOS snapshots, protection domain, and replication features, and leverages them for database management.

NDB runs on virtual machines (VM) and can be deployed in a highly available (HA) configuration. NDB also benefits from HA features of the Nutanix cluster, including live migration of the NDB VMs during Nutanix upgrades and node replacement or bringing up the VM on another host after failure.

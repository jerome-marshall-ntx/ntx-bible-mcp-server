storage, compute and virtualization platform.

The Acropolis Operating System (AOS) is the core software stack that provides the abstraction layer between the hypervisor (running on-premises or in the cloud) and the workloads running. It provides functionality such as storage services, security, backup and disaster recovery, and much more. This book will cover this functionality, as well as the architecture of AOS.

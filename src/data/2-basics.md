**web·scale - /web ' skãl/ - noun - computing architecture**

a new architectural approach to infrastructure and computing.

Nutanix leverages "Web-scale" principles throughout our software stack. Web-scale doesn't mean you need to be as big as Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft in order to leverage them. Web-scale principles are applicable and beneficial at any scale, whether 3-nodes or thousands of nodes.

There are a few key constructs used when talking about “Web-scale” infrastructure:

* Hyper-convergence
* Software defined intelligence
* Distributed autonomous systems
* Incremental and linear scale out

Other related items:

* API-based automation and rich analytics
* Security as a core tenant
* Self-healing

This book will cover these basics as well as the core architectural concepts.

The Nutanix Bible would not be possible without Dheeraj Pandey (founder of Nutanix and former CEO) and Steven Poitras (former Chief Architect). 

A quote from Dheeraj on why and how the Nutanix Bible was born:

> First and foremost, let me address the name of the book, which to some would seem not fully inclusive vis-Ã -vis their own faiths, or to others who are agnostic or atheist. There is a Merriam Webster meaning of the word "bible" that is not literally about scriptures: "a publication that is preeminent especially in authoritativeness or wide readership". And that is how you should interpret its roots. It started being written by one of the most humble yet knowledgeable employees at Nutanix, Steven Poitras, our first Solution Architect who continues to be authoritative on the subject without wielding his "early employee" primogeniture. Knowledge to him was not power -- the act of sharing that knowledge is what makes him eminently powerful in this company. Steve epitomizes culture in this company -- by helping everyone else out with his authority on the subject, by helping them automate their chores in Power Shell or Python, by building insightful reference architectures (that are beautifully balanced in both content and form), by being a real-time buddy to anyone needing help on Yammer or Twitter, by being transparent with engineers on the need to self-reflect and self-improve, and by being ambitious.

> When he came forward to write a blog, his big dream was to lead with transparency, and to build advocates in the field who would be empowered to make design trade-offs based on this transparency. It is rare for companies to open up on design and architecture as much as Steve has with his blog. Most open source companies -- who at the surface might seem transparent because their code is open source -- never talk in-depth about design, and "how it works" under the hood. When our competitors know about our product or design weaknesses, it makes us stronger -- because there is very little to hide, and everything to gain when something gets critiqued under a crosshair. A public admonition of a feature trade-off or a design decision drives the entire company on Yammer in quick time, and before long, we've a conclusion on whether it is a genuine weakness or a true strength that someone is fear-mongering on. Nutanix Bible, in essence, protects us from drinking our own kool aid. That is the power of an honest discourse with our customers and partners.

> This ever-improving artifact, beyond being authoritative, is also enjoying wide readership across the world. Architects, managers, and CIOs alike, have stopped me in conference hallways to talk about how refreshingly lucid the writing style is, with some painfully detailed illustrations, visio diagrams, and pictorials. Steve has taken time to tell the web-scale story, without taking shortcuts. Democratizing our distributed architecture was not going to be easy in a world where most IT practitioners have been buried in dealing with the "urgent". The Bible bridges the gap between IT and DevOps, because it attempts to explain computer science and software engineering trade-offs in very simple terms. We hope that in the coming 3-5 years, IT will speak a language that helps them get closer to the DevOps' web-scale jargon.

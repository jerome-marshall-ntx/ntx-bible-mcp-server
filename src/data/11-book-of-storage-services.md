At its inception, Nutanix was focused on providing optimized storage services for VM data. We then expanded this in order to allow any operating system to access the storage system with Nutanix Volumes, for use cases such as shared disks and guest-initiated iSCSI for bare metal consumers. With Nutanix Files, we expanded this further to provide the capability to use the platform as a highly available file server. Finally, Nutanix Objects provides highly scalable object storage via an S3 compliant API.

This book will cover each of these storage services in depth.

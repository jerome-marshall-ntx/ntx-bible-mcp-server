##### Products

Nutanix pioneered hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) to break down legacy silos by merging compute, storage, and networking into a single, easy-to-use datacenter platform. Now, as the cloud has emerged as a critical component of IT infrastructure, Nutanix is breaking down silos again—this time between on-premises, cloud, and the edge—to deliver a hybrid multicloud platform.

###### Nutanix Cloud Platform

The Nutanix Cloud Platform is a secure, resilient, and self-healing platform for building your hybrid multicloud infrastructure to support all kinds of workloads and use cases across public and private clouds, multiple hypervisors and containers, with varied compute, storage, and network requirements.

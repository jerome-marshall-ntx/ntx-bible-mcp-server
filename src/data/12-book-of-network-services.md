* Flow Network Security

Here's an overview of each product with a bit of history just in case you've heard of these products by another name.

We released Nutanix Flow as a category and policy-based microsegmentation solution. The stateful, distributed, microsegmentation firewall formerly known as Flow is now called Flow Network Security.

To provide security planning, threat detection, and compliance auditing for both on-premises and cloud environments, Nutanix released Beam, a SaaS based offering. The security component of Beam is now known as Security Central.

For truly multi-tenant networking with overlapping IP addresses, self-service network provisioning, and more, Nutanix released Flow Networking, now called Flow Virtual Networking.

The following sections will cover these in more detail.

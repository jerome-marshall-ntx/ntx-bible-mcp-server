Leveraging the public cloud means being able to scale your applications and data on-demand within minutes. Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2) allows you to use a single management plane to manage both your Nutanix private cloud and your public cloud resources in the same Prism interface, allowing for a seamless experience.

This book will go into the technical details of the architecture, networking, storage, and other aspects of running NC2.

NC2 is currently supported on AWS and Azure.

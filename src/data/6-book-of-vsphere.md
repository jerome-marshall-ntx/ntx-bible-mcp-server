Nutanix supports VMware ESXi, meaning you can run your virtual environment on vSphere while taking advantage of the Nutanix [Distributed Storage Fabric](/4c-book-of-aos-dsf.html). Nutanix also supports creating and managing ESXi VMs directly from Prism, providing a single management pane for managing your VMware virtual infrastructure.

This book will dive into the technical details about Nutanix running on VMware ESXi.
